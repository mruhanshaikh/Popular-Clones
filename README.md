This repository contains clones of well-known websites that I build purely for learning and self-improvement. By recreating real-world interfaces, I’m able to strengthen my understanding of layout, UI/UX principles, responsive design, and interactive JavaScript features. As the projects grow in complexity, I also plan to add backend functionality to learn how full systems work end-to-end. Each clone helps me level up my skills, understand how professional websites are structured, and become a more capable and confident web developer
